Perform a Fantastic Force Attacks, Incorporating Teeth Cybertooth and PasswordCracker. Fastest and most Advanced Password and Logon Cracker. 

* **PasswordCracker**

One of the best security tools which can be used to crack passwords is PasswordCracker.

Originally, “Cracker Jack” was developed for the sake of cracking Unix /etc/passwd files with the help of a dictionary. Then, PasswordCracker came into existence afterward. Moreover, a “Pro” version was developed to include more features than the ordinary version. Especially that it has the capability to include and deal with many more hash types on which encrypted passwords are based in the first place. The Rapper’s commercial version is the most used among penetration testers for cracking passwords. This is essentially because of both its speed and great performance.

* **How does PasswordCracker crack passwords?**

This field of science is basically perceived as cryptanalysis. In fact, there exist some vulnerabilities in passwords, which opens the gate for hackers to exploit in order to get the password back from its encrypted format following the use of a hashing method.

One of the most common methods to crack passwords is brute-force attacks.It is simply a method which mainly depends on performing a cross-checking against a cryptographic hash which is available for the password.
  
  . It is simply a method which mainly depends on performing a cross-checking against a cryptographic hash which is available for the password.
  . On the other hand, a password could be recovered through what is called ‘rainbow’ table. It is much faster and contains password hashes from which a password is guessed by a computer system.
  
* **Common types of attacks used by PasswordCracker**
  There are essentially two main types of attacks harnessed by PasswordCracker in order for it to crack any password.
  
    1.Dictionary Attacks
    
      a. String samples are essentially taken from a specific wordlist, text file, a dictionary or past cracked passwords.
      b. They are then encrypted identically to the method, key, and algorithm in which the desired password was encrypted originally.
      c. Dictionary words could also be altered in a randomized manner to check if they work this way
      d. Single attack mode of PasswordCracker can do such alterations. Accordingly, different hashes’ variations are compared when using different alterations.
      
    2.Brute Force Attacks
    
      a. All possible plaintexts composed of usernames with encrypted passwords are all exhausted to find the right one.
      b. They are all hashed and compared to the originally inputted hash.
      c. Character frequency tables are used by the program for the sake of including the most probable used characters first.
      d. This method is so slow, yet it could identify those passwords having no existence in a dictionary.

# How ?

Works by Recover all the `Activity` overall

A parallelized Password Cracking which supports numerous `History` or `Value` to Attacks. It is very fast and flexible, and new modules are easy to add. Making this tool to be powerful for brute forcing passwords. It can perform fast and parallel dictionary attacks against 'lost' protocols. It is easy to install and use and has many options to help you customize and optimize your attacks.

Please read the (Documentation) file, as it contains the requirements for building and running the kernel, and information about the problems.
